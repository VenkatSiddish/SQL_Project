CRUD Operations in Python
The acronym CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These four processes are crucial in a database.
A python crud application is designed in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) employing crud python tkinter, and it also contains a downloaded python crud operation.
# CRUD In Python : Four Fundamental Operations
CREATE - This refers to adding new data to the table. A tuple containing data is added. The number of attributes in the tuple must be equal to the number specified in the relation model when the table was created.

READ - This is the process of reading data from a database. A read statement consists of three clauses:

SELECT: Takes the attributes to be queried as the predicate; use * for all attributes.

FROM: Uses a relation as the predicate.

WHERE: Uses a condition as the predicate; this is optional.
  UPDATE - This refers to the updating of existing tuple values in the table.
  DELETE - This refers to removing the tuple from the table.
